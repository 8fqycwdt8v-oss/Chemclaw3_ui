/**
 * Conversation state shapes.
 *
 * The one structural decision worth calling out: a `Conversation` has its own local `id`,
 * separate from the server's `sessionId`. The backend's session handle is disposable — it can be
 * evicted from a bounded live-session LRU, and a restarted pod without durable storage loses it —
 * so binding the user's visible transcript to it would mean losing history for no reason. The
 * local id owns the transcript; the session id is swapped underneath it when needed.
